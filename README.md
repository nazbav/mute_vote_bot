# [@mutevotebot](https://telegram.me/mutevotebot) and [@silent_mutevotebot](https://telegram.me/mutevotebot) code
This repository contains the code for the democracy bots I've built. Readme is still in work, any contributions are welcome.

# Installation and local launch
1. Clone this repo: `git clone https://github.com/backmeupplz/mutevotebot`
2. Launch the [mongo database](https://www.mongodb.com/) locally
3. Create `.env` file with `TELEGRAM_API_KEY` and `MONGO_DB_URL`
4. Run `npm i` in the root folder
5. Run `npm run start`

And you should be good to go! Feel free to fork and submit pull requests. Thanks!

# Continuous integration
